### **Motivation for using KnitR**

You can complete all the coding exercises in the JAGS Primer using simple R scripts. However, you might be wondering about how we created the JAGS Primer key you are looking at right now. We did this using [Yihui Xie's](http://yihui.name/knitr/) `knitr` package in R. This can be a highly useful tools for organizing your Bayesian analyses. Within the same document, you can:

* Describe the model and specify the joint distribution using $\LaTeX$ and RMarkdown.
* Write the R and JAGS code for implementing your model in JAGS.
* Run the model directly in JAGS.
* Summarize the convergence diagnostics and present results.
* Add anything else pertinent to your analysis.

Best of all, ``knitr`` can produce beautiful html files as output, which can be easily shared with collaborators.   We encourage you to become familiar with ``knitr``. We recommend Karl Broman's [knitr in a nutshell](http://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell/) as an excellent introductory tutorial.

### **Exercise 1: Factoring** 

There is no **x** in the posterior distribution in equation 4. What are assuming if x is absent? Draw the Bayesian network, or DAG, for this model. Use the chain rule to fully factor the joint distribution into sensible parts then simplify by assuming that $r$, $K$ and $\tau$ are independent.

<button class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#myDIV1"> Answer </button>  
<div id="myDIV1" class="collapse"> 
<br>

There is no $x$ because we are assuming it is measured without error.

</div>

<div style="width:300px; margin:0 auto;">
<figcaption><center>Fig 1. Bayesian network for logistic model.</center></figcaption>
</div>

Factoring the joint using the chain rule:
$$[r,K,\tau, \mathbf{y}]=[y\mid r,K,\tau][r|K,\tau][K|\tau][\tau]$$

Simplifying under the assumption of $r,K,\tau$ are independent: 
$$[r,K,\tau, \mathbf{y}]=[y\mid r,K,\tau][r][K][\tau]$$

We would obtain the same result by inspecting the DAG and using the rules: 

* All random variables on at the head of arrows must be on the lhs of a conditioning symbol.
* All random variables at the tails of arrows must be on the rhs of a conditioning symbol.
* All random variables at the tails of arrows with no arrows coming into them must be expressed unconditionally. 

</div>

### **Exercise 2: Can you improve these priors?**

A recurring theme in this course will be to use priors that are informative whenever possible. The gamma priors in equation 4 of the JAGS Primer include *the entire number line $>0$.* Don't we know more about population biology than that? Lets, say for now that we are modeling the population dynamics of a large mammal. How might you go about making the priors on population parameters more informative?

<button class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#myDIV2"> Answer </button>  
<div id="myDIV2" class="collapse"> 
<br>

A great source for priors in biology are allometric scaling relationships that predict all kinds of biological quantities based on the mass organisms (Peters, 1983; Pennycuick,1992). If you know the approximate mass of the animal, you can compute broad but nonetheless informative priors on $r$ and $K$. This might leave out the social scientists, but I would trust the scaling of $r$ for people if not $K$. 

In the absence of some sort of scholarly way to find priors, we can at least constrain them somewhat. There is no way that a large mammal can have an intrinsic rate of increase exceeding 1 -- many values for $r$ within gamma(.001, .001) are far large than than that and hence are complete nonsense. We know $r$ must be positive and we can put a plausible bound on its upper limit. The only requirement for a vague prior is that its "$\ldots$ range of uncertainty should be clearly wider that the range of reasonable values of the parameter$\ldots$" (Gelman and Hill, 2009, page 355), so we could use $r$ ~ uniform(0, 2) and be sure that it would be minimally informative. Similarly, we could use experience and knowledge to put some reasonable bounds on $K$ and even $\sigma$, which we can use to calculate $\tau$ as $\tau=\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}$.

### **Exercise 3: Using `for loops`**

Write a code fragment to set vague normal priors for 5 regression coefficients -- `dnorm(0, 10E-6)` -- stored in the vector **b**.

### **Exercise 4: Coding the logistic regression**

Write R code (algorithm 3) to run the JAGS model (algorithm 3) and estimate the parameters, $r$, $K$ $\sigma$, and $\tau$. We suggest you insert the JAGS model into this R script using the `sink()` command as shown in algorithm 4. because this model is small. You will find this a convenient way to keep all your code in the same R script. For larger models, you will be happier using a separate file for the JAGS code. Here is the joint distribution for our logistic model again, with the priors updated from exercise 2 and $\tau$ expressed as a derived quantity:

\begin{eqnarray}
\mu_{i} & = & r-\frac{rx_{i}}{K}\textrm{,}\nonumber\\[1em] 
\tau & = & \frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}\textrm{,}\nonumber\\[1em]  
\left[r,K,\sigma\mid\mathbf{y}\right] & \propto & \prod_{i=1}^{n}\textrm{normal}\left(y_{i} \mid \mu_{i},\tau\right)\textrm{uniform}\left(K\mid 0,4000\right) \textrm{uniform}\left(\sigma\mid 0, 5\right) \textrm{uniform}\left(r\mid 0,2\right)\textrm{.}\nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}

<button class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#myDIV4"> Answer </button>  
<div id="myDIV4" class="collapse"> 
<br>

We use the `sink()` command to create a JAGS script from our joint distribution. This file is created within R and saved in the working directory. Please note that the outer set of brackets are only required when running this code within an R markdown document (as we did to make this answer key). If you are running them in a plain R script, they are not needed.

``` {r, eval = TRUE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
{ # Extra bracket needed only for R markdown files
sink("LogisticJAGS.R")
cat(" 
model {
  
  # priors
  
  K ~ dunif(0, 4000)
  r ~ dunif (0, 2)
  sigma ~ dunif(0, 50) 
  tau <- 1/sigma^2
  
  # likelihood
  
  for(i in 1:n) {
    
    mu[i] <- r - r/K * x[i]
    y[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau)
  
  }
} 

",fill = TRUE)
sink()
} # Extra bracket needed only for R markdown files

```

Then we run the remaining commands discussed in the JAGS Primer. Note that `jm` is calling the JAGS script `LogisticJAGS.R` we just created.

``` {r, eval = TRUE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
#Be sure to do this sorting.  It will be important for plotting later.
Logistic <- Logistic[order(Logistic$PopulationSize),]

inits = list(
  list(K = 1500, r = .2, sigma = .01),
  list(K = 1000, r = .15, sigma = .5),
  list(K = 900, r = .3, sigma = .01))

data = list(
  n = nrow(Logistic),
  x = as.double(Logistic$PopulationSize),
  y = as.double(Logistic$GrowthRate))

n.adapt = 1000
n.update = 10000
n.iter = 10000

jm = jags.model("LogisticJAGS.R", data = data, inits = inits, n.chains = length(inits), n.adapt = n.adapt)
update(jm, n.iter = n.update)
zm = coda.samples(jm, variable.names = c("K", "r", "sigma", "tau"), n.iter = n.iter, n.thin = 1)
MCMCsummary(zm)
```

</div>

### **Exercise 5: Understanding coda ojects**

1) Look at the first six rows of the data frame.
2) Find the maximum value of $\sigma$.
3) Find the mean of $r$ for the first 1000 iterations.
4) Find the mean of $r$ after the last 1000 iterations.
5) Make two publication quality plots of the marginal posterior density of `K`, one as a smooth curve and the other as a histogram.
6) Compute the probability that `K` > 1600. Hint: what type of probability distribution would you use for this computation?  Investigate the the dramatically useful R function `ecdf()`.
7) Compute the probability that 1000 < `K` < 1300.
8) Compute the .025 and .975 quantiles of `K`.  Hint--use the R `quantile()` function.

# Look at the first six rows:

# Find the probability that the parameter 1000 < K < 1300 
ecdf(df$K)(1300) - ecdf(df$K)(1000)

# Compute the .025 and .975 quantiles of K
quantile(df$K, c(.025, .975))

### **Exercise 6: Summarizing coda objects**

Summarize the coda output from the logistic model with 4 significant digits. Include Rhat and effective sample size diagnostics (more about these soon). Summarize the coda output for $r$ alone.

### **Exercise 7: Using MCMCchains**

Extract the chains for `r` and `sigma` as a data frame using `MCMCchains` and compute their .025 and .975 quantiles from the extracted object.  Display three significant digits. Make a publication quality histogram for the chain for `sigma`. Indicate the .025 and .975 Bayesian equal-tailed credible interval value with  vertical red lines. Overlay the .95 highest posterior density interval with vertical lines in blue. This is a "learn on your own" problem intended to allow you to rehearse the most important goal of this class: being sufficiently confident to figure things out.  Load the package `HDinterval`, enter `HDInterval` at the console and follow your nose. Also see Hobbs and Hooten Figure 8.2.1.

#### **Exercise 8: Plotting data and model predictions using the MCMCpstr formatting**

For the logistic model:

1. Plot the observations of growth rate as a function of observed population size.
2. Overlay the median of the model predictions as a solid line.
3. Overlay the 95% equal-tailed credible intervals as dashed lines in red.
4. Overlay the 95% highest posterior density intervals as dashed lines in blue. 
5. What do you note about these two intervals? Will this always be the case? Why or why not?
6. What do the dashed lines represent?  What inferential statement can we make about  relative these lines?


<button class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#myDIV8"> Answer </button>  
<div id="myDIV8" class="collapse"> 
<br>

``` {r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Fig. 4. Median and 95% credible intervals for predicted growth rate and posterior density of K.", eval = TRUE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}

zm = coda.samples(jm, variable.names = c("K", "r", "sigma", "mu"),  n.iter = 10000)
BCI <- MCMCpstr(zm, params = "mu", func = function(x) quantile(x, c(.025, .5, .975)))
HPDI <-  MCMCpstr(zm, params = "mu", func = function(x) hdi(x, .95))

plot(data$x, data$y, pch = 19, xlab = "Population size", ylab = "Per-capita grwoth rate (1/year)" )
lines(data$x,BCI$mu[,2], typ = "l")
lines(data$x, BCI$mu[,1], lty = "dashed", col = "red")
lines(data$x, BCI$mu[,3], lty = "dashed", col = "red")
lines(data$x, HPDI$mu[,1], lty = "dashed", col = "blue") 
lines(data$x, HPDI$mu[,2], lty = "dashed", col = "blue")  
```

The intervals are exactly overlapping in this particular case. Such overlap will not always occur. Equal-tailed intervals based on quantiles will be broader than highest posterior density intervals when marginal posterior distributions are asymmetric. There is a 95% probability that the true value of the mean per-capita population growth rate falls between these lines. Not that this differs from the prediction of a new observation of population growth rate, which would have much broader credible intervals.

### **Exercise 9: Creating caterpillar plots with MCMCplot**

Use the MCMCplot function to create caterpillar plots to visualize the posterior densities for $r$, and $\sigma$ using the coda object `zm` from earlier. Then use `MCMCplot()` to explore different plotting options. There are lots of these options, including ways to make the plots publication quality, show overlap with zero, etc.

### **Exercise 10: Assessing convergence**

Rerun the logistic model with ``n.adapt = 100``. Then do the following:

1. Keep the next 500 iterations. Assess convergence visually with `MCMCtrace()` and with the Gelman-Rubin, Heidelberger and Welch, and Raftery diagnostics.
2. Update another 500 iterations and then keep 500 more iterations. Repeat your assessment of convergence. 
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until you feel you have reached convergence.
4. Change the adapt phase to zero and repeat steps 1 -- 4. What happens?

### **ADVANCED Exercise 11: Coding the logistic regression to run in parallel**

Append R code (algorithm 5) to the script you made in exercise 4 to run the JAGS model (algorithm 2) in parallel and estimate the parameters, $r$, $K$ $\sigma$, and $\tau$. Use the `proc.time()` function in R to compare the time required for the sequential and parallel JAGS run. If your computer has 3 threads, try running only 2 chains in parallel when doing this exercise. If you have fewer than 3 threads, work with a classmate that has at least 3 threads.

cl <- makeCluster(3)

initsP = function() {list(K = runif(1, 10, 4000), r = runif(1, .01, 2), 
  sigma = runif(1, 0, 2),  .RNG.name = "base::Mersenne-Twister", 
  .RNG.seed = runif(1, 1, 2000))}

parallel::clusterExport(cl, c("data", "initsP", "n.adapt", "n.update", "n.iter"))

ptm <- proc.time()

out <- clusterEvalQ(cl, {
  library(rjags)
  jm = jags.model("LogisticJAGS.R", data = data, n.chains = 1, 
  n.adapt = n.adapt, inits = initsP())
  update(jm, n.iter = n.update)
  zm = coda.samples(jm, variable.names = c("K", "r", "sigma", "tau"), 
  n.iter = n.iter, thin = 1)
  return(as.mcmc(zm))
}) 

ParallelTime <- proc.time() - ptm
ParallelTime

stopCluster(cl)
zmP = mcmc.list(out)
MCMCsummary(zmP)
```

We rerun the model sequentially and use `proc.time()` again for comparison.

``` {r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
ptm <- proc.time()
jm = jags.model("LogisticJAGS.R", data = data, inits = inits, n.chains = length(inits), n.adapt = n.adapt)
update(jm, n.iter = n.update)
zm = coda.samples(jm, variable.names = c("K", "r", "sigma"), n.iter = n.iter, n.thin = 1)
SequentialTime <- proc.time() - ptm
SequentialTime
```

Looks as if the parallel model runs `r round(SequentialTime[3]/ParallelTime[3],2)` times faster. This factor should increase the more iterations you run (why?).

You might be very tempted, in the name of reproducible science, to set the seed inside each worker to the same value. What happens when you do this? Compare the results from this run to the previous run using `MCMCsummary()` and `MCMC(trace)`.
