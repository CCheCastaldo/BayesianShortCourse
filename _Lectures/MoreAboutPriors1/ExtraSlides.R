## Bayes Theorem 

$$\underbrace{[\theta|y]}_\text{Posterior} = \frac{\overbrace{[y|\theta]}^\text{Likelihood}\overbrace{[\theta]}^\text{Prior}}{\underbrace{\int [y | \theta][\theta] d\theta}_\text{Marginal}}$$

- Likelihood: Links unobserved $\theta$ to observed $y$.
- Prior Distribution: What is already known about $\theta$.
- Marginal Distribution: the area under the joint distribution curve. Serves to normalize the curve with respect to $\theta$.
- Posterior Distribution: a true PDF.

## Mary's Notes That Need Translated

Insert meta analysis example

- I went to the literature and I found things that I might consider using as a prior.
- Show how I would use what I found to make and informed prior
- Insert SESYNC board notes
- Go to Meta Analysis lab and make a mini version that is not in the context of pediatric death
