## **Marginal distributions**: they allow us to isolate the univariate distribution of a variable that is jointly distributed.

## Discrete Example
We are studying a species for which births occur in pulses.  We observe 100 females and record the age of each animal and the number of offspring produced.

## Note:
- The function $[x,y]$ specifies the joint probability of the discrete random variables $x$ and $y$
  - $\Sigma_x[x,y]$ is the marginal probability of $y$ and
  - $\Sigma_y[x,y]$ is the marginal probability of $x$.
- This same idea applies to any number of jointly distributed random variables. We simply sum over all but one.
