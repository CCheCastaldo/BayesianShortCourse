## Why Bayes?

Problems poorly suited to traditional approaches:

- Multiple sources of data
- Multiple sources of uncertainty
- Missing data
- Inference across scales
- Unobservable quantities
- Multimodal data
- Derived quantities
- Forecasting
- Synthesis

## Why Bayes?

SESYNC is dedicated to fostering synthetic, actionable science related to the structure, functioning, and sustainability of socio-environmental systems.

# What sets Bayes apart?

## Exercise

Describe how Bayesian analysis differs from other types of statistical analysis.

## Some notation

- $y$ data
- $\theta$ a parameter or other unknown quantity of interest
- $[y\mid\theta]$ The probability distribution of $y$ conditional on $\theta$
- $[\theta\mid y]$ The probability distribution of $\theta$ conditional on $y$
- $P(y\mid\theta)=p(y\mid\theta)=[y\mid\theta]=f(y\mid\theta)=f(y,\theta)$, different notation that means the same thing.

## Exercise

Please write the definition of a 95% frequentist confidence interval on a parameter $\theta$.


## Confidence envelopes

## What do we do in Bayesian modeling?
\includegraphics[width=0.30\paperwidth]{../../_Graphics/Random_variable.pdf}

- We divide the world into things that are observed $(y)$ and things that are unobserved $(\theta)$.
- The unobserved quantities $(\theta)$ are random variables. 
- The data $y$ are random variables before they are observed and fixed after they have been observed.
- We seek to understand the probability distribution of $\theta$ using fixed observations, i.e., $[\theta\mid y]$.
